# Network Fundamentals  
**TryHackMe – Pre Security Path**

This README documents the concepts and knowledge covered in the **Network Fundamentals** room.  
It focuses on understanding how networks work and why networking is a core concept in cybersecurity.

## 📌 Task 1 – What is Networking

Networks are simply things connected together.  
In computing, networking refers to connecting technological devices so they can communicate and share resources.

### Key Concepts
- Networks exist everywhere in daily life (transport systems, power grids, communication)
- In computing, networks connect devices such as:
  - Computers
  - Mobile phones
  - Servers
  - IoT devices (cameras, traffic lights, farming systems)
- Networks can range from **2 devices to billions**
- Networking is essential in cybersecurity because all digital communication relies on networks

---

## 🌐 Task 2 – What is the Internet

The Internet is a **global network made up of many smaller networks** connected together.

### Key Concepts
- The Internet is a *network of networks*
- Small networks are called **private networks**
- Networks connecting them form **public networks (the Internet)**
- Early development began with **ARPANET** in the late 1960s
- The **World Wide Web (WWW)** was invented in 1989 by **Tim Berners-Lee**
- The Internet allows large-scale communication and information sharing

## 🖥️ Task 3 – Identifying Devices on a Network

Devices must be identifiable to communicate properly on a network.

### Device Identification Methods
Devices are identified using:
- **IP Address** (logical, changeable)
- **MAC Address** (physical, hardware-based)

---

### 🔢 IP Addresses

- Used to identify a device on a network for a period of time
- IPv4 addresses consist of **four sections called octets**
- An IP address cannot be used by more than one device on the same network at the same time
- Devices can have:
  - **Private IP addresses** (used inside local networks)
  - **Public IP addresses** (used on the Internet)

### IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4 supports approximately **4.29 billion** addresses
- IPv6 was introduced due to address exhaustion
- IPv6 supports **2¹²⁸ addresses** and improves efficiency

---

### 🧬 MAC Addresses

- MAC stands for **Media Access Control**
- Assigned to network interfaces at the factory
- Represented as a **12-character hexadecimal value**
- Example format: `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`

### Security Insight
- MAC addresses can be **spoofed**
- MAC-based trust can be abused in poorly designed networks
- MAC filtering is often used in public Wi-Fi environments

---

## 📡 Task 4 – Ping (ICMP)

Ping is a basic network troubleshooting tool.

### Key Concepts
- Ping uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
- ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply measure:
  - Connectivity
  - Latency
- Ping can be used on:
  - Local networks
  - Internet hosts

### Usage
- Used to verify if a host is reachable
- Helps identify network delays or connectivity issues

---

## 🔐 Security Perspective

From a cybersecurity point of view:
- Networking knowledge is critical for both attackers and defenders
- IP and MAC addressing play a key role in identification and access control
- Misconfigured networks can allow spoofing and unauthorized access
- ICMP can reveal useful network information if not properly restricted

---

## ✅ Outcome

By completing this room, the following foundational knowledge was gained:
- Understanding how networks and the Internet function
- How devices identify and communicate with each other
- Why networking concepts are essential in cybersecurity
