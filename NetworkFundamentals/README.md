# TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals

This repository documents my hands-on learning from the TryHackMe Network Fundamentals path.

## Modules Completed
- OSI Model
- Intro to LAN
- Packets and Frames
- Extending Your Network
- (Networking Basics Overview)

---

## OSI Model
- Learned the 7-layer OSI model and real-world protocol mapping
- Understood where protocols like HTTP, TCP, IP, ARP operate
- Practiced identifying attack surfaces per OSI layer

## Intro to LAN
- Difference between LAN, WAN, VLAN
- Role of switches, routers, and access points
- Broadcast domains vs collision domains

## Packets and Frames
- Packet vs frame differences
- Ethernet frame structure (MAC, payload, FCS)
- How encapsulation works across OSI layers

## Extending Your Network
- NAT, port forwarding, and routing basics
- Firewalls and basic network segmentation
- How networks connect to the internet securely

---

## Security Perspective
- Importance of network segmentation
- Risks of flat networks
- How attackers move laterally in LAN environments

## Tools & Concepts
- OSI Model
- TCP/IP
- Ethernet
- NAT & Routing
- Basic Network Security

## Outcome
Gained foundational understanding of how data moves across networks and how misconfigurations can impact security.
